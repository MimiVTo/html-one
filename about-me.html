    <h1>Mimi's Favorite Childhood Memory</h1>
    <p>In my childhood, I mostly spent it with my mother. However, I did get dropped off at my maternal grandmother's house a lot. When I was there, 
        I would hang out with my grandma in the garden. Usually in the garden, I would help my grandmother water her flowers. When we finished, she 
        would make my favorite snack, Vietnamese Springrolls since she was Hoa Vietnamese. Her spring rolls were the best. Which also means I'm picky
        with my springrolls now. I also really liked Mulan as a kid--the animated movie not the live action. Live action sucks.
